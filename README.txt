Introduction
============

The codec ``safename`` is meant to rename files to safe filenames.  These
safe filenames have the following properties:

- The safe filenames are valid on most filesystems.
- The safe filenames can be restored to the original filenames.
- The safe filenames are more or less readable.

Examples:

+---------------+---------------+
| Input         | Output        |
+===============+===============+
| ``Spam``      | ``{s}pam``    |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``SPAM``      | ``{spam}``    |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``spam eggs`` | ``spam_eggs`` |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``sp√†m``      | ``sp(e0)m``   |
+---------------+---------------+

The script ``safename`` will rename a list of files, by applying the codec
``safename`` to the current filenames.


Usage
=====

    safename [-d|--decode] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose] [FILE ...]
    safename [-e|--encode] [-t|--test] [-v|--verbose] [FILE ...]

Based on the module ``safefilename`` from Torsten Bronger's
`Bobcat Project <https://launchpad.net/bobcat>`_.
